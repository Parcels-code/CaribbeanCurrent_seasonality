Repository for Vesna's project: Seasonal patterns of the Caribbean Current and its influence on the small island of Curaçao 

This project contains the following folders:

## Project Structure:

- [**Eulerian_analysis**](./Eulerian_analysis/): Contains the scripts to analyse geostrophic flow at 69.0 E meridional cross-section for the 32-year period
- [**Lagrangian_analysis**](./Lagrangian_analysis/): Contains scripts to run and analyse Parcels experiments to track Caribbean Current across the Caribbean Sea and the stength of the inflow
- [**wind_analysis**](./wind_analysis/): Contains scripts to analyse wind data
- [**integrated_spectra_combined**](./integrated_spectra_combined/): Contains scripts to plot all 4 wavelet spectra (integrated in time) for comparison of spectra
